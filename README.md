Padma-Tokens consist of tokens for <strong>more than 10,000 volumes</strong> of Buddhadharma text in Tibetan language. 
</p>

### :sos: what?

This repository contains tokens (words) from two sets of Tibetan texts:

- [OpenPecha](https://github.com/OpenPecha) with over ten thousand volumes of texts
- [Richen Terndzo](https://rtz.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page) with 71 volumes of texts

If you have or know of bodies of texts that we should tokenize and add, [please let us know](https://github.com/Lotus-King-Trust/Padma-Tokens/issues) about it.

The texts are tokenized using [Botok](https://github.com/Esukhia/botok), an industrial-scale tokenization pipeline for Tibetan text on Python. 

The tokens are maintained "as-code" which means that new and updated tokens are generated, including tokenization and all the related procedures without any human involvement. <strong>This approach reduce chance for human error, as well as provides 100% transparency</strong> to anyone interested in benefiting from the tokens.

### :gem: why?

If advanced linguistic technology (i.e. NLP) is an engine, then tokens are the fuel. Most downstream NLP applications depend on availability of high quality tokens. Possible uses include:

- perform classical word statistics (most frequent etc.)
- create word, sentence, and document similarity
- train word and other vector representations
- develop automated translation tools

The tokens are in live use in the next-generation of [Tibetan Translation Tools](http://padma.io) Padma.io.
